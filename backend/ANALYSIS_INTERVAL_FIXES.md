# Analysis Interval Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Analysis Interval Too Short ❌
**Problem**: Analysis was running every 60 seconds (1 minute) instead of 10 minutes
**Solution**: Updated `trade_interval_secs` from 60 to 600 seconds

### 2. Skipping Analysis for Active Trades ❌
**Problem**: Pairs with active trades were being skipped from analysis
**Requirement**: Analysis should run for ALL pairs every 10 minutes regardless of active trades
**Solution**: Modified `should_skip_pair_analysis()` to only skip cooldown, not active trades

### 3. Poor Logging ❌
**Problem**: Unclear logging about which pairs were being analyzed and when
**Solution**: Enhanced logging with timestamps and clear pair identification

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates (config.py)

```python
# Updated analysis interval
'trade_interval_secs': 600,  # 10 minutes between analysis cycles

# Added analysis settings
'analyze_all_pairs': True,  # Always analyze all pairs regardless of active trades
'analysis_interval_minutes': 10,  # Analysis interval in minutes
```

### 2. Skip Logic Fix (websocket_server.py)

**Before**:
```python
def should_skip_pair_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> bool:
    # Skip if pair has active trades
    if symbol in self.trading_bot.bot_active_trades:
        logger.info(f"[ACTIVE_TRADE] {symbol} has active trade, skipping analysis")
        return True
    # ... cooldown logic
```

**After**:
```python
def should_skip_pair_analysis(self, symbol: str) -> bool:
    # Check if we should analyze all pairs regardless of active trades
    analyze_all = self.trading_bot.bot_config.get('analyze_all_pairs', True)
    
    # Only skip if pair is in cooldown period (for new trades, not analysis)
    if symbol in self.trading_bot.bot_cooldown_end:
        if time.time() < self.trading_bot.bot_cooldown_end[symbol]:
            remaining = self.trading_bot.bot_cooldown_end[symbol] - time.time()
            logger.info(f"[COOLDOWN] {symbol} in cooldown, {remaining:.0f}s remaining")
            return True
    
    # Log if pair has active trade but still performing analysis
    if symbol in self.trading_bot.bot_active_trades and analyze_all:
        logger.info(f"[ANALYSIS] {symbol} has active trade, but performing analysis as scheduled")
    
    return False
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging

**Analysis Cycle Start**:
```
Bot is enabled, running AI analysis for configured pairs at 14:24:24
```

**Pair Analysis**:
```
[ANALYSIS] SOLUSDT has active trade, but performing analysis as scheduled
Starting concurrent AI analysis for 3 pairs: ['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'SOLUSDT']
```

**Analysis Cycle End**:
```
AI analysis cycle completed, waiting 600 seconds until 14:34:24
```

## Expected Behavior

###  **Every 10 Minutes**:
- Analysis runs for ALL configured pairs (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT)
- Pairs with active trades are still analyzed
- Only pairs in cooldown are skipped
- Clear logging shows which pairs are being analyzed

###  **Analysis Results**:
- All pairs get AI analysis results broadcasted
- Trade opportunities are identified for pairs without active trades
- Active trades continue to be monitored separately

###  **Logging Examples**:
```
14:24:24 INFO Bot is enabled, running AI analysis for configured pairs at 14:24:24
14:24:24 INFO [ANALYSIS] SOLUSDT has active trade, but performing analysis as scheduled
14:24:24 INFO Starting concurrent AI analysis for 3 pairs: ['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'SOLUSDT']
14:24:24 INFO AI analysis completed for BTCUSDT
14:24:24 INFO AI analysis completed for ETHUSDT
14:24:24 INFO AI analysis completed for SOLUSDT
14:24:24 INFO AI analysis cycle completed, waiting 600 seconds until 14:34:24
```

## Configuration Options

### Analysis Settings:
- `analyze_all_pairs`: `True` - Always analyze all pairs
- `trade_interval_secs`: `600` - 10 minutes between cycles
- `analysis_interval_minutes`: `10` - Analysis interval in minutes

### Override via Environment:
```bash
export BOT_ANALYSIS_INTERVAL=600  # 10 minutes
export BOT_ANALYZE_ALL_PAIRS=true
```

## Testing

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Analysis every 60 seconds (too frequent)
- ❌ SOLUSDT skipped due to active trade
- ❌ Unclear logging

### After Fix:
-  Analysis every 600 seconds (10 minutes)
-  SOLUSDT analyzed despite active trade
-  Clear logging with timestamps
-  All pairs analyzed as scheduled

## Files Modified

1. **backend/config.py**
   - Updated `trade_interval_secs` to 600
   - Added `analyze_all_pairs` and `analysis_interval_minutes` settings

2. **backend/websocket_server.py**
   - Modified `should_skip_pair_analysis()` logic
   - Enhanced logging with timestamps
   - Updated analysis cycle messaging

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Logs**: Verify analysis runs every 10 minutes for all pairs
2. **Test Active Trades**: Confirm pairs with active trades still get analyzed
3. **Performance**: Monitor if 10-minute intervals provide optimal results
4. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust interval if needed based on market conditions
