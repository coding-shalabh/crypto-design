# WebSocket Stability Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Backend "Set changed size during iteration" error**: The `broadcast_message` function was modifying the `self.clients` set while iterating over it
2. **Frontend rapid reconnections**: Multiple simultaneous connection attempts causing server overload
3. **Excessive logging and broadcasts**: Too frequent price updates causing performance issues
4. **No connection limits**: Unlimited simultaneous connections could overwhelm the server

## Backend Fixes (websocket_server.py)

### 1. Fixed Broadcast Function
- **Problem**: `broadcast_message` was modifying `self.clients` set during iteration
- **Solution**: Create a copy of the clients set before iterating
- **Code Change**:
```python
# Create a copy of clients set to avoid modification during iteration
clients_copy = self.clients.copy()
disconnected_clients = set()

for client in clients_copy:
    try:
        await client.send(json.dumps(message))
    except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
        disconnected_clients.add(client)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error sending to client: {e}")
        disconnected_clients.add(client)

# Remove disconnected clients from the original set
for client in disconnected_clients:
    self.clients.discard(client)
```

### 2. Added Connection Limits
- **Problem**: Unlimited simultaneous connections
- **Solution**: Limit to 10 simultaneous connections
- **Code Change**:
```python
# Check connection limit
if len(self.clients) >= 10:  # Limit to 10 simultaneous connections
    logger.warning(f"Connection limit reached, rejecting client {client_id}")
    await websocket.close(1013, "Too many connections")
    return
```

### 3. Reduced Broadcast Frequency
- **Problem**: Price updates every 5 seconds causing excessive load
- **Solution**: Reduced to every 10 seconds with longer error delays
- **Code Change**:
```python
await asyncio.sleep(10)  # Reduced frequency to every 10 seconds
# ...
await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Longer delay on error
```

## Frontend Fixes (useWebSocket.js)

### 1. Added Connection State Tracking
- **Problem**: Multiple simultaneous connection attempts
- **Solution**: Added `isConnectingRef` to track connection state
- **Code Change**:
```javascript
const isConnectingRef = useRef(false); // Track connection state

// Prevent multiple simultaneous connection attempts
if (isConnectingRef.current || (wsRef.current && (wsRef.current.readyState === WebSocket.CONNECTING || wsRef.current.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN))) {
    console.log('🔍 useWebSocket: Connection already exists or connecting, skipping');
    return;
}

isConnectingRef.current = true;
```

### 2. Improved Connection Management
- **Problem**: WebSocket reference not properly cleared on disconnect
- **Solution**: Clear reference and reset connection state
- **Code Change**:
```javascript
wsRef.current.onclose = (event) => {
    // Clear the reference
    wsRef.current = null;
    isConnectingRef.current = false;
    // ... rest of disconnect logic
};
```

### 3. Increased Initial Data Delay
- **Problem**: Sending requests too quickly after connection
- **Solution**: Increased delay from 1 second to 2 seconds
- **Code Change**:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    // Load initial data
}, 2000); // Increased delay to 2 seconds
```

## Testing

Created `test_connection_stability.py` to verify fixes:
- Tests single connection stability for 30 seconds
- Tests multiple simultaneous connections
- Monitors message reception and connection behavior

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ No more "Set changed size during iteration" errors
2. ✅ Stable WebSocket connections without rapid connect/disconnect cycles
3. ✅ Reduced server load from excessive broadcasts
4. ✅ Better connection management and error handling
5. ✅ Connection limits prevent server overload

## Usage

1. **Restart the backend server**:
```bash
cd backend
python websocket_server.py
```

2. **Restart the frontend**:
```bash
npm start
```

3. **Test connection stability**:
```bash
python test_connection_stability.py
```

## Monitoring

Watch for these indicators of success:
- Backend logs show stable client connections
- No rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- Frontend shows stable connection status
- No "Set changed size during iteration" errors
- Reasonable message frequency in logs
